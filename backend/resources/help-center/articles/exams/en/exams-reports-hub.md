# Exams Reports Hub

The Exams Reports Hub is the central page for exam-related reports. Staff with exam or student report permissions use it to quickly open the Consolidated Mark Sheet, Class–Subject Mark Sheet, or Student Report (report cards). The hub shows one card per report type with a short description and a “Generate report” button that takes you to the corresponding report page. There are no filters or data tables on this page—only links to the actual report pages.

## Page Overview

When you open the Reports Hub, you will see:

### Summary Cards

This page does not have summary cards. It shows report-type cards instead (see below).

### Filters & Search

This page has no filters or search. Selection of exam, class, subject, or student is done on each report page after you leave the hub.

## Report Type Cards

The main content is a grid of cards. Each card represents one report type. Visibility of each card depends on your permissions:

| Report Type | Description | Link | Shown if |
|-------------|-------------|------|----------|
| **Consolidated Mark Sheet** | Class-wise mark sheet with all subjects, ranks, totals, percentage, grade, and result (Pass/Fail/Incomplete). | `/exams/reports/consolidated` | You have `exams.read` (or exam reports permission). |
| **Class–Subject Mark Sheet** | Subject-wise mark sheet for one class and one subject (or all classes/subjects for bulk export). | `/exams/reports/class-subject` | You have `exams.read`. |
| **Student Report** (Exam Reports) | Student-wise report card for one or more students: subjects, marks, total, percentage, grade, result. | `/exams/reports/student` | You have `students.read`. |

Each card has:

- An icon and title.
- A short description of what the report shows.
- A **Generate report** (or equivalent) button that navigates to that report’s page.

Clicking the card or the button opens the same report page.

## How to Use (Help Card)

At the bottom of the hub, a “How to use” card repeats short descriptions for:

- Consolidated Mark Sheet
- Class–Subject Mark Sheet

This is a quick reminder of what each report is for; the actual filters, tables, and export options are on the linked report pages.

## Tips & Best Practices

- Use the hub as your starting point when you are not sure which exam report you need; the descriptions help you pick the right one.
- Bookmark or use the sidebar link to the Reports Hub for quick access from anywhere in the exams section.
- If you do not see a report card (e.g. Student Report), you may lack the required permission; contact your administrator.
