# Exam Documents

The Exam Documents page is where you store and manage files related to exams, such as question papers, answer keys, instructions, results, grade sheets, and other documents. You filter by exam and document type, search by title or description, and for each exam you can upload, view, download, and delete documents in a dedicated dialog. This keeps all exam-related files in one place per exam.

## Tips & Best Practices

- Use **Document Type** consistently (e.g. always use "Answer Key" for answer keys) so filtering and reporting are reliable.
- Add a short **Description** when uploading so you can find documents later with Search.
- Filter by **Exam** when you need to see or upload documents for one exam only.
- Use the exam name link in the table to open that exam’s documents without using the upload flow.
