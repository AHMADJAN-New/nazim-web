# Exam Papers Print Tracking

The Print Tracking page lets you see which exam papers have been printed, how many copies were printed, when they were last printed, and who printed them. You can filter by school, subject, exam, and print status; open paper details; and use Preview/Print to open the paper preview and update print status. This helps keep exam distribution under control and avoid duplicate printing.
