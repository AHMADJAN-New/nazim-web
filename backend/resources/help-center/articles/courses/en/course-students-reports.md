## Tips & Best Practices

- Use **Course** and **Status** filters to narrow the list before selecting students for bulk Mark Completed or Mark Dropped.
- Use **Select All** (header checkbox) to select all visible filtered students, then use **Mark as Completed** or **Mark as Dropped** after confirming in the dialog.
- Export to Excel or PDF after applying filters to get reports for a specific course or status (e.g. only completed students).
