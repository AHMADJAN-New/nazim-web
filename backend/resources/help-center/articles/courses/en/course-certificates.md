## Tips & Best Practices

- Filter by **Course** when you need certificates for one course only (e.g. for distribution).
- Use **Search** to find a student by name or admission number before previewing or downloading.
- Certificates are only shown for students who are **Completed** and have had **Issue Certificate** used (from Course Students or Course Students Reports). Issue certificates from the Course Students page when a student completes the course.
