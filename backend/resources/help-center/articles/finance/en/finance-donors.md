# Donors

The Donors page is where you manage people and organizations that give money or support to your school. You can add donor details (name, type, contact, notes), see how much each donor has given in total, and use this list when recording income. Keeping donor records up to date helps with thank-you letters, reports, and communication.

## Tips & Best Practices

- Enter at least name and one contact method (phone or email) for follow-up.

- Use the search to quickly find a donor before recording a donation.
- Prefer marking a donor Inactive instead of deleting if they have donation history.
