# Finance Reports

The Finance Reports page gives you a single place to view and generate key financial reports for your school. School administrators and finance staff see the daily cashbook, income vs expense comparison, project and donor summaries, and account balances. All reports respect the date range you choose and can be exported to PDF or Excel.

## Page Overview

When you open Finance Reports, you will see a row of tabs at the top. Each tab shows one type of report. Where relevant, the From / To date filters are shared.

### Tabs

- **Cashbook** — Daily cashbook: opening balance, income, expenses, closing balance, and list of transactions for the selected date, per account.
- **Income vs Expense** — Income vs expense summary and trends: totals, net balance, time-series chart, and pie charts by income and expense category.

- **Donors** — Donor summary: total donors, total donations, table by donor and top donors chart.
- **Balances** — Account balances: total balance, opening and current balance per account, and balance distribution pie chart.

### Filters & Search

- **From** — Start date of the report period (date picker). Used in Cashbook (in context), Income vs Expense, Projects, and Donors.
- **To** — End date of the report period (date picker). In the **Cashbook** tab this is the only date used for the daily cashbook display.
- **Time range** (Income vs Expense tab only) — Dropdown: Last 7 days, Last 30 days, or Last 90 days, to limit the trend chart to that period.
