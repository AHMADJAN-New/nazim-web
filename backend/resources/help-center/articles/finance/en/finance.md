# Finance

The Finance module is the central place for managing your school's money: income, expenses, accounts, projects, donors, and reports. School administrators and finance staff use it to record donations and fees, track spending, manage cash and fund accounts, and view dashboards and reports. Good use of this module keeps finances transparent and organized.

## Page Overview

The Finance section in the sidebar does not open a single "Finance" page. Instead, it groups these sub-pages:

### Main Finance Pages

- **Finance Dashboard** — Overview of total balance, net profit, assets, expenses, active projects, income by category, and recent transactions. Quick links to Accounts, Income, and Reports.
- **Finance Accounts** — Manage cash locations and funds (e.g., Main Cash Box, Donation Fund). Each account has opening balance, current balance, and currency. You record income and expenses against these accounts.
- **Income Entries** — Record and manage all income (donations, fees, grants, etc.). Each entry has account, category, amount, date, optional donor/project, and payment method.
- **Expense Entries** — Record and manage all expenses. Each entry has account, category, amount, date, paid-to, payment method, and status (approved, pending, rejected).
- **Income Categories** — Define types of income (e.g., General Donation, Zakat, Tuition). Used when recording income entries.
- **Expense Categories** — Define types of expenses (e.g., Salaries, Utilities). Used when recording expense entries.
- **Projects & Funds** — Create projects or funds (e.g., Ramadan Iftar Project) with optional budget and date range. Income and expenses can be linked to projects.
- **Donors** — Manage donors (individuals or organizations) and track total donated. Income entries can be linked to donors.

## Typical Workflow

1. **Set up basics** — Add at least one Currency (Finance Settings or Currencies page if available), then create at least one Finance Account (e.g., Main Cash).
2. **Define categories** — Create Income Categories and Expense Categories so you can classify entries.
3. **Record transactions** — Use Income Entries to record income and Expense Entries to record expenses. Optionally link to Projects and Donors.
4. **Review** — Use the Finance Dashboard and Finance Reports to review totals, trends, and account balances.

## Tips & Best Practices

- Create at least one active Finance Account before recording any income or expense.
- Use consistent income and expense categories so reports are meaningful.
- For donor-funded projects, create a Project and link both income and expenses to it for clear tracking.
- Use the Dashboard’s “Cash only” vs “Including assets & books” toggle to focus on liquid balance when needed.
