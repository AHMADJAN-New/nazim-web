# Fee Dashboard

The Fee Dashboard gives you an overview of fee collection and management for your school. You see total assigned fees, total paid, remaining amounts, collection rate, exception counts, and charts by status and class. Administrators and finance staff use it to monitor collection progress and jump quickly to Fee Structures, Assignments, Payments, Exceptions, or Fee Reports. The dashboard is under **Finance → Fees → Dashboard**.

## Page Overview

When you open the Fee Dashboard, you will see summary cards at the top, then a row of charts (status distribution, collection by class, exception breakdown), and below that recent payments and quick action buttons.

### Summary Cards

- **Total Assigned** — Sum of all fee amounts assigned to students for the selected academic year (and class if filtered). Shows number of assignments. A **View Assignments** button links to the Fee Assignments page.
- **Total Paid** — Sum of all payments recorded in the period. Shows the collection rate (percentage of assigned that has been collected).
- **Total Remaining** — Sum of outstanding (unpaid) amounts. Shows how many students still have a balance. A **View Reports** button links to Fee Reports.
- **Exceptions** — Number of active fee exceptions (discounts, waivers). Shows total value of those exceptions and, if applicable, the reduction in collectible amount. A **View Exceptions** button links to Fee Exceptions.
- **Collection Rate** — Percentage of total assigned fees that have been collected (Total Paid ÷ Total Assigned). A progress bar shows this visually. Text explains it is “of total assigned.”

### Filters & Search

- **Academic Year** — Dropdown to select the academic year. The dashboard data (cards, charts, recent payments) is limited to this year. Default is usually the current academic year.
- **Class** — Optional dropdown to limit data to a specific class (class academic year). “All” shows all classes.
- There is no text search on the dashboard; use Fee Reports or Fee Assignments to search by student name or admission number.

## Tips & Best Practices

- Set the academic year at the start so all cards and charts match the same year.
- Use the Collection Rate and Total Remaining cards to prioritize follow-up with defaulters.
- Use “Collection by Class” to see which classes need more collection effort.
- Use Quick Actions instead of the menu when you often switch between fee pages.
