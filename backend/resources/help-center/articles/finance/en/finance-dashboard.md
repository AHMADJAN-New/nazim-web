# Finance Dashboard

The Finance Dashboard gives you an overview of your organization's finances in one place. You see total balance, net profit for the month, assets, expenses, active projects, income and expense breakdowns, recent transactions, and account balances. Staff with finance access use it to monitor cash flow and quick-jump to Accounts, Income, Reports, and Assets.

## Page Overview

When you open the Finance Dashboard, you will see:

### Summary Cards

- **Total Balance** — The combined balance across all finance accounts. A toggle lets you switch between "Including assets & books" (cash + assets value + library books value) and "Cash only" (liquid balance only). A breakdown shows Cash Balance, Assets (if any), and Library Books value (if any). A trend shows percentage change vs last month. A **View Accounts** button takes you to Finance Accounts.
- **Net Profit** — Income minus expenses for the current month. Shown in green if positive, red if negative. A trend shows percentage vs last month.
- **Total Assets Value** — Total value of assets linked to finance. A **View Assets** button takes you to the Assets module.
- **Total Library Books Value** — Total value of library books (if tracked). A **View Library Books** button takes you to Library Books.
- **Expenses** — Current month total expenses. Shown with a trend percentage vs last month.
- **Active Projects** — Count of active projects. Also shows count of active donors.

### Filters & Search

The dashboard shows data for the **current month** by default. A date range label at the top displays the first and last day of the current month. There is a Download (icon) button in the header. No separate search or filter panel; the view is fixed to the current month summary.

- If you use projects, the Active Projects card helps you see how many are currently active.
