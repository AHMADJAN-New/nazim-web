# Projects & Funds

The Projects & Funds page helps you manage separate projects or funds (e.g., Ramadan Iftar Project, Building Fund) and track income, expenses, and balance for each. Staff use it to see funding progress, total income and expenses per project, and to keep project finances separate from general accounts. This is useful for donor-funded or time-bound initiatives.

## Tips & Best Practices

- Set a budget amount when you have a target; the progress bar helps you see how much has been funded.
- Use start and end dates for time-bound projects so you can report and close them appropriately.
- Choose the correct currency so amounts and reports are consistent.
- Prefer marking a project Inactive instead of deleting it if it has historical transactions.
