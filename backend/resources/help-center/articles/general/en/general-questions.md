## Login and Account

### How do I log in?

Open the application in your browser, enter your email and password, and click the login button. If you do not have an account, ask your school administrator to create one for you.

### I forgot my password. What should I do?

Use the "Forgot password" link on the login page (if available) to reset your password by email. If you do not see this option or it does not work, contact your school or system administrator.

### Why can't I see some menus or pages?

The menus and pages you see depend on your **permissions**. Your administrator assigns permissions to your role or to your user account. If you need access to a feature (e.g. Finance, Exams, Settings), contact your administrator to request the right permission.

## Organization and School

### What is the difference between organization and school?

Your **organization** is your institution (e.g. the main school or trust). A single organization can have multiple **schools** (e.g. different campuses or branches). Your data (students, staff, reports) is scoped to your organization and, where applicable, to the school you have selected.

### How do I switch to a different school?

If your organization has more than one school, use the **school switcher** in the header or sidebar to select the school you want to work with. Lists, dashboards, and reports will then show data for that school.

### Why don't I see a school switcher?

The school switcher appears only when your organization has multiple schools and your account is allowed to access more than one. If you have only one school, or your role is limited to one school, you may not see it.

## Language and Calendar

### How do I change the language?

Use the **language switcher** (usually in the header or user menu) to choose your preferred language (e.g. English, Pashto, Farsi, Arabic). The interface and help content will update accordingly. Some languages use right-to-left (RTL) layout.

### How do I change the calendar type?

You can set your **calendar preference** (e.g. Gregorian, Jalali/Shamsi, Hijri Qamari) in your profile or in the application settings. Dates across the system will then be shown in the selected calendar.

## Dashboard and Navigation

### What is the Dashboard?

The **Dashboard** is the main overview page after login. It shows summary cards (e.g. total students, staff, classes), charts such as students by class, quick links to key pages, and tabs for Finance, Library, Attendance, etc. — depending on your permissions.

### Why do I see fewer cards or tabs than my colleague?

The Dashboard shows only the modules you have permission to use. If you have access to Students but not Finance, you will see student-related cards and tabs but not finance ones. Ask your administrator if you need more permissions.

### Where do I find my profile and settings?

Open the **user menu** (your name or avatar in the top-right). From there you can go to **Profile** to edit your name and phone, or to **Settings** to access other options. The exact items depend on your permissions.

---

## Data and Reports

### Is my school's data separate from other schools?

Yes. Data is isolated by **organization** and **school**. You only see and work with data for your organization and, where applicable, the school you have selected.

### How do I export data to Excel or PDF?

Many list and report pages have **Export** buttons (e.g. "Export to Excel" or "Export to PDF"). Use the filters on the page to narrow the data, then click the export button. The exported file will match the current filters.

## Getting Help

### Where can I get more help?

- Use the **Help** or **Help Center** in the application (if available) for articles on specific features.
- Contact your **school administrator** for account issues, permissions, and school-specific processes.
- For technical or system-level support, follow the support process provided by your organization or the Nazim support team.

### I found a bug or something doesn't work. What should I do?

Report the issue to your school administrator or to the technical support contact provided by your organization. Include what you were doing, what you expected, and what happened (and, if possible, a screenshot or the exact error message).
