# Getting Started

The Nazim School Management System helps your school manage students, staff, attendance, finance, exams, and more in one place. This guide explains how to log in, understand the main interface, and complete basic setup so you can start using the system effectively.

---

## Logging In

1. Open the Nazim application in your web browser (the URL is provided by your school or organization).
2. Enter your **email address** and **password** in the login form.
3. Click **"Log in"** (or the equivalent button).
4. If your credentials are correct, you will be taken to the **Dashboard**. If you see an error, check that your email and password are correct and that your account is active.

**Note:** If you do not have an account, contact your school administrator to create one for you.

---

## First Time: Organization and School

- When you first log in, your account is linked to an **organization** (your school or institution) and a **default school** if the organization has multiple schools.
- The data you see (students, staff, classes, etc.) is always limited to your organization and, where applicable, your default school.
- If your organization has more than one school, you can switch the active school using the **school switcher** in the header or sidebar so that lists and reports show the correct school’s data.

---

## The Main Interface

After login you will see:

### Header

- **Top bar** — Shows the current date, and often a school switcher (if you have multiple schools). On the right you have access to your **user menu** (your name or avatar). From there you can open **Profile**, **Settings**, or **Log out**.

### Sidebar

- The **sidebar** on the left (or right in RTL languages) contains the main navigation: **Dashboard**, **Students**, **Staff**, **Attendance**, **Finance**, **Exams**, **Settings**, and other modules. Only menu items you have permission to use are shown.
- You can collapse the sidebar to show only icons for more space.

### Main Content Area

- The main area shows the page you selected (e.g. Dashboard, Students list, or a report). Use the sidebar to move between sections.

---

## Dashboard

- The **Dashboard** is your starting page after login. It shows:
  - **Summary cards** (e.g. total students, staff, classes, rooms) — only for modules you have permission to see.
  - **Charts** such as students by class (if you have the right permissions).
  - **Quick actions** to go to Students, Staff, Classes, or Buildings.
  - **Tabs** for Overview, Finance, Assets, Library, Attendance, Leave, or Documents — again, only the tabs you have permission for.
- Click any card or quick action to go to the related page for more detail.

---

## Language and Calendar

- The application supports **multiple languages** (e.g. English, Pashto, Farsi, Arabic). You can change the language from the **language switcher** (often in the header or user menu). The interface and help text will follow your choice.
- You can also choose your **calendar preference** (e.g. Gregorian, Jalali/Shamsi, or Hijri Qamari). Dates across the app will be shown in the selected calendar.

---

## Your Profile

- To view or edit your own details (name, phone, avatar), go to **Profile** or **Settings → Profile** (depending on how your menu is set up).
- There you can update your **full name**, **phone**, and **avatar URL**. Your **email** and **role** are set by the administrator and cannot be changed by you.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Complete initial setup** — If you are an administrator, ensure organization and school details, academic years, classes, and subjects are configured under Settings.
2. **Use the Dashboard** — Monitor key numbers and use quick actions to open the modules you need.
3. **Open module pages** — Use the sidebar to go to Students, Staff, Attendance, Finance, Exams, etc., and perform your daily tasks.
4. **Check reports** — Use the Reports and export options in each module for deeper analysis.

---

## Tips & Best Practices

- **Bookmark the login URL** so you can open the application quickly.
- **Use the school switcher** when you work with more than one school so that data and reports are for the correct school.
- **Set your language and calendar** once in your profile or settings so that all dates and labels match your preference.
- **Ask your administrator** for permissions if you do not see a menu or feature you need.
