# Graduation Dashboard

The Graduation Dashboard is the main hub for managing student graduations in your school. School administrators and staff use this page to see an overview of all graduation batches, track batch status (draft, approved, issued), view recent and upcoming graduations, and quickly access batch creation, certificate templates, and issued certificates. Everything you need to manage the graduation workflow is available from this single page.

## Page Overview

When you open the Graduation Dashboard, you will see:

### School Filter

If your organization has **multiple schools**, a **School** filter appears at the top. Select a school to view graduation data for that school only. If you have only one school, it is selected automatically. You must select a school to see any graduation statistics or lists; otherwise a message will ask you to select a school above.

### Summary Cards

- **Total Batches** — The total number of graduation batches (all statuses) for the selected school.
- **Draft** — Number of batches that are still in draft (not yet approved). These batches can be edited and need "Generate Students" and "Approve" steps.
- **Approved** — Number of batches that have been approved and are ready for certificate issuance.
- **Issued** — Number of batches for which certificates have already been issued.

### Current Year Statistics (if current academic year is set)

- **Current Year Batches** — Number of graduation batches belonging to the current academic year. The academic year name is shown below the number.
- **Certificates Issued This Year** — Approximate count of certificates issued in the current academic year (sum of students in issued batches for that year).

### Quick Actions

Three action buttons let you jump to key workflows:

- **Create New Batch** — Opens the Graduation Batches page with the create dialog, so you can start a new graduation batch (final year, promotion, or transfer).
- **View Templates** — Goes to the Certificate Templates page where you can create and edit graduation certificate templates (layout, background, placeholders).
- **Issued Certificates** — Goes to the Issued Certificates page where you can view and manage all certificates that have been issued.

### Recent Batches

A list of the **last 5** most recent batches, sorted by graduation date (newest first). Each row shows:

- Academic year name and status badge (Draft / Approved / Issued)
- Class name and graduation date
- Student count

Clicking a row opens the batch detail page for that batch. A **"View All"** link at the top right takes you to the full Graduation Batches list.

### Pending Approvals

A list of batches that are still in **Draft** status (up to 5). These need "Generate Students" and "Approve" before certificates can be issued. Each row is clickable and goes to the batch detail page. If there are no draft batches, the section shows "No pending approvals."

### Upcoming Graduations

This section appears only when there are batches with a graduation date in the **next 30 days**. It lists those batches (up to 5) so you can prepare for upcoming ceremonies. Each row is clickable and goes to the batch detail page.

## Tips & Best Practices

- **Select the correct school** — If you have multiple schools, always select the school first; all numbers and lists are filtered by that school.
- **Use Quick Actions** — Create batches and manage templates directly from the dashboard instead of hunting through menus.
- **Check Pending Approvals** — Review draft batches regularly and complete "Generate Students" and "Approve" so certificates can be issued on time.
- **Use "View All"** — When you need the full list with filters and table/card view, use "View All" to go to the Graduation Batches page.
