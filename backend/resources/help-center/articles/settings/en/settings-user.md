# User Settings

The User Settings page lets you manage your own account preferences and security. You can choose how dates are displayed (calendar type) and change your password. There are no data tables or list actions—only form-based settings. All users can open this page to update their preferences and password.

## Page Overview

When you open this page, you will see:

### Summary Cards

This page does not have summary cards.

### Tabs

The page has two tabs:

1. **Preferences** — Date and calendar display settings.
2. **Security** — Change password form.

---

## Preferences Tab

The Preferences tab shows the **Date Preference Settings** card.

### What This Setting Controls

- **Calendar system:** How dates are displayed across the application (e.g. in reports, forms, and tables). Your choice applies to your account only.

### Calendar System Options

You can choose one of three calendar types via radio buttons:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Gregorian** | Standard Western calendar (e.g. December 24, 2024). |
| **Hijri Shamsi (Jalali)** | Solar Hijri calendar used in Iran and Afghanistan (e.g. ۴ جدی ۱۴۰۳). |
| **Hijri Qamari** | Lunar Islamic calendar (e.g. ۲۲ جمادی الثانی ۱۴۴۶ هـ). |

### Preview

A preview section shows how the current date and date-time will look with your selected calendar. This updates when you change the selection.

### Saving

- After you change the calendar, click **Save** (or the equivalent “Save” button with check icon) to apply.
- The system saves your choice to your profile and to local storage so dates update immediately across the app.
- A success or error message appears after save.

### Note

An information note explains that your calendar preference affects how dates are shown everywhere in the system (reports, forms, lists).

## Security Tab

The Security tab contains the **Change Password** card.

### What This Section Does

- Lets you set a new password for your account. You must enter your current password and the new password twice. Passwords are validated before submission.

### Change Password Form

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| Current Password | Password (with show/hide toggle) | Yes | Your current login password. |
| New Password | Password (with show/hide toggle) | Yes | The new password. Must meet all requirements below. |
| Confirm New Password | Password (with show/hide toggle) | Yes | Must match the new password exactly. |

### Password Strength

While you type the new password, a strength indicator appears (e.g. Weak, Fair, Good, Strong, Very Strong) with a coloured bar. Use it to ensure the password is strong enough.

### Password Requirements (validation)

The new password must meet all of the following:

- At least 8 characters.
- At least one uppercase letter (A–Z).
- At least one lowercase letter (a–z).
- At least one number (0–9).
- At least one special character (e.g. ! @ # $ % ^ & * ( ) , . ? " : { } | < >).

If any requirement is not met, the form shows an error and will not submit until the new password and confirmation are valid and match.

### Submit

- Click **Update Password** (or the equivalent submit button). While submitting, the button may show “Updating…” and be disabled.
- On success, a “Password changed successfully” message appears and the form resets.
- On error (e.g. wrong current password), an error message appears.

## What Depends on User Settings

- **Calendar preference:** Used by all date displays (reports, forms, tables, dashboards) for your session. Other users have their own preferences.
- **Password:** Only affects your login. Changing it does not change your role, permissions, or profile data (name, email, etc.). For profile details, use the Profile or Account Profile page.

## Tips & Best Practices

- Choose the calendar that matches how your school or region records dates (e.g. Shamsi for Afghanistan) so reports and forms feel natural.
- Use a strong, unique password and change it periodically. Avoid reusing passwords from other sites.
- Use the show/hide (eye) buttons to double-check that you typed the new password and confirmation correctly before submitting.
- If you forget your password, use the “Forgot password” flow on the login page (if enabled) instead of User Settings.
