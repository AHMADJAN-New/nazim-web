# Library Dashboard

The Library Dashboard gives you an overview of your library’s books, copies, loans, and value with summary cards, charts, and quick links. School administrators and librarians use it to see totals, availability, overdue and due-soon counts, total library value, books by category, monthly loan trends, and most borrowed books. A **View Reports** action takes you to Library Reports.
