# Subscription Plans

The Subscription Plans page lets you view available subscription plans and choose one for a new subscription or upgrade. Each plan has a name, price (in AFN or USD), feature highlights, and limits (e.g. students, schools). Selecting a plan takes you to the renewal page; the Enterprise plan opens a contact dialog instead. School administrators use this page to compare plans and start a renewal or upgrade.

## Page Overview

When you open the Subscription Plans page (from the Subscription page via **View Plans**, or from the sidebar), you will see:

### Header

- **Back** — Arrow button linking back to **Subscription**.
- **Title** — "Subscription Plans".
- **Description** — "Choose the plan that fits your needs".

### Select Your Plan Card

- **Title** — "Select Your Plan".
- **Description** — All plans include yearly subscription with a 14-day grace period after expiry.
- **Plan selector** — A grid of plan cards (e.g. Starter, Pro, Complete, Enterprise). Trial is usually not selectable (automatic).

### Plan Cards (typical)

Each plan card shows:

- **Plan name** (e.g. Starter, Pro, Complete, Enterprise).
- **Price** — Shown in selected currency (AFN or USD). Enterprise may show "Contact Us".
- **Highlights** — Bullet list of what the plan includes (e.g. "Up to 250 students", "10 users", "Exams Lite", "Timetable & attendance").
- **License fee** — If applicable (one-time).
- **Select** or **Choose** button — Clicking it either:
  - **Standard plans** — Navigates to the renewal page with the plan and optional additional schools.
  - **Enterprise** — Opens a contact dialog so you can request a quote or contact sales.

### FAQ Section

A card titled **Frequently Asked Questions** with common questions and answers:

- **What happens when my subscription expires?** — 14-day grace period with full access; then up to 60-day read-only mode; then blocked until renewal.
- **How do I pay for my subscription?** — Manual payments (bank transfer, cash, check, mobile money). Submit details via the renewal form; team verifies and activates.
- **Can I add more schools later?** — Yes. Enterprise supports multiple schools; additional schools can be add-ons at a per-school rate.
- **Can I upgrade my plan?** — Yes. You can upgrade anytime; price difference is prorated for the remaining period.

3. Optionally switch **currency** (AFN / USD) if the selector is shown.
4. Click **Select** (or equivalent) on the plan you want.
5. **If not Enterprise** — You are taken to the **Renew Subscription** page with that plan pre-selected. Complete the renewal form and submit.

## Tips & Best Practices

- **Compare limits** (students, users, schools) with your current or expected size before choosing.
- **Use the FAQ** to understand expiry, grace period, read-only, and payment process.
- **Choose Enterprise** if you need custom limits, multi-branch, or multi-currency; use the contact dialog to get a quote.
- **Renew before expiry** to avoid grace period and read-only; use the Renew button from the main Subscription page after selecting a plan.
