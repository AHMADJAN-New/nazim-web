# Subscription

The Subscription page is your central place to view and manage your organization’s Nazim subscription. You can see your current plan, status (active, trial, grace period, expired, etc.), resource usage, features, payment history, and links to license and maintenance fees. School administrators use this page to monitor subscription health and renew or upgrade when needed.

- **Read-only mode** — You can view but not edit data. **Renew Now** to restore full access.
