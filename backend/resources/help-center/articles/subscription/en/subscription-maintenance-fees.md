# Maintenance Fees

The Maintenance Fees page shows your organization’s recurring maintenance fee status, list of maintenance invoices, and payment history. You can see whether maintenance is paid, overdue, or when the next payment is due. Payments are submitted through your platform administrator; this page is for viewing status and history. School administrators use it to track maintenance obligations and invoice due dates.

## Tips & Best Practices

- **Check the status card** first to see if maintenance is overdue or when the next payment is due.
- **Use the invoices table** to see which invoices are pending or overdue and contact your administrator with the invoice number.
- **Use payment history** to confirm that past maintenance payments were recorded correctly.
- **Contact your platform administrator** for any actual payment submission; this page does not process payments.
