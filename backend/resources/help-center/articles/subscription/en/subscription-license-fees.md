# License Fees

The License Fees page shows your organization’s one-time license fee status and payment history. You can see whether the license has been paid, is pending confirmation, or is unpaid. Payments are submitted through your platform administrator; this page is for viewing status and history. School administrators use it to confirm license payment and track past license payments.

## Tips & Best Practices

- **Check status** to see if the license is paid before relying on full software access; some features may depend on it.
- **Use payment history** to verify that a license payment was recorded and confirmed.
- **Contact your platform administrator** to submit or follow up on license payment; this page does not process payments.
