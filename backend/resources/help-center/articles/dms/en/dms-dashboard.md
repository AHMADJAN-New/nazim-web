# Document System Dashboard

The Document System (DMS) Dashboard gives you a quick overview of incoming and outgoing document activity for your school. Administrators and office staff use it to see how many documents were received or sent in the current week and month, how many are waiting to be routed, and how many are confidential or higher security. From here you can jump straight to Incoming or Outgoing documents to work with the list.

## Tips & Best Practices

- Check the dashboard at the start of the day to see how many incoming and outgoing documents need attention.
- Use "Pending routed documents" to prioritize follow-up on documents that have been sent to departments but not yet completed.
- Use the sidebar tabs (Incoming, Outgoing, Templates, Reports, etc.) to manage documents, templates, and run reports—the hint at the bottom of the page reminds you of this.
