# Academic Years

The Academic Years page is where you create and manage academic years (e.g., 2024–2025, 1403). Each academic year has a name, start date, end date, status (active, archived, planned), and an optional "current" flag. Classes, subjects, timetables, and exams are organized by academic year. School administrators use this page to define the yearly cycle and to set which year is the current one for the system.

## Data Table

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Name | Academic year name (e.g., 2024-2025). The current year shows a "Current" badge next to the name. |
| Start Date | Start date of the academic year (formatted per your calendar preference). |
| End Date | End date of the academic year. |
| Status | Badge: Active, Archived, or Planned. |
| Is Current | Shows "Current" badge if this is the current year; otherwise a "Set as Current" button (if you have update permission). |
| Actions | Edit (pencil), Delete (trash). Delete is hidden or disabled for the current year. |

### Row Actions

- **Set as Current** — Click to set this academic year as the current one. The system uses the current year for default selections (e.g., in Classes, Subjects, Timetable Generation). Only one year can be current at a time.
- **Edit** — Opens the create/edit dialog with the year’s data pre-filled so you can change name, dates, description, status, or "Is Current".
- **Delete** — Opens a confirmation dialog. You cannot delete the year that is marked as current. Deleting may affect classes, subjects, and timetables linked to that year; confirm after reading the warning.

## Creating a New Academic Year

1. Click **Add Academic Year**.
2. In the dialog:
   - **Name** * (required) — e.g., "2024-2025" or "1403".
   - **Start Date** * (required) — Use the date picker; must be before end date.
   - **End Date** * (required) — Use the date picker; must be after start date.
   - **Description** (optional) — Notes about the year.
   - **Status** — Active, Archived, or Planned (default: Active).
   - **Is Current** — Toggle to set this year as the current one (optional; you can set it later from the table).
3. Click **Save**.

The new academic year appears in the table. You can then assign classes to it (Classes page) and build subjects and timetables for it.

## Tips & Best Practices

- Create the next academic year in advance and set it as **Current** when the new year starts so that Classes, Subjects, and Timetable Generation default to the correct year.
- Use **Status**: Active for the current and recent years, Archived for past years, and Planned for future years so filters and reports stay clear.
- Ensure **End Date** is after **Start Date**; the form validates this. Use your organization’s actual term or calendar dates.
- Only one year should be **Current** at a time; setting a new current year automatically clears the flag from the previous one.
