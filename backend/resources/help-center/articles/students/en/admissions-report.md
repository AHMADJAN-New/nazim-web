# Admissions Report

The Admissions Report page shows admission statistics and a detailed list of admissions that you can filter by school, academic year, residency type, enrollment status, boarder yes/no, and date range. Summary cards give quick counts (e.g. total admissions, by status); the table lists each admission with student and placement details. You can export the report as PDF or Excel so the exported data matches the current filters.

## Page Overview

When you open the Admissions Report page, you will see:

### Summary Cards

Cards at the top show aggregate numbers such as total admissions, counts by enrollment status (e.g. Active, Admitted, Pending, Withdrawn, Graduated), and possibly by boarder/residency. These update when you change filters.

### Filters

- **School** — Filter by school (if your organization has multiple schools).  
- **Academic Year** — Filter by academic year.  
- **Residency Type** — Filter by residency type (e.g. Day scholar, Boarder).  
- **Enrollment Status** — Filter by status (e.g. Pending, Admitted, Active, Inactive, Suspended, Withdrawn, Graduated).  
- **Boarder** — Yes/No (or All) to filter boarders only or non-boarders only.  
- **Date range** — **From date** and **To date** to limit admissions by admission date. If From is after To, the range is invalid and the report may not load or may show a warning.  
- **Reset** — A control to clear all filters and reset to defaults.

### Report Table

A table lists each admission that matches the current filters. Columns typically include:

- Student name, Admission number, Card number  
- School, Class, Section, Academic year  
- Residency type, Boarder (Yes/No), Room  
- Guardian name, Guardian phone  
- Enrollment status, Admission date  

Pagination is available to move through pages and change page size.

### Export Buttons

- **Export PDF** — Generates a PDF report of the filtered admissions. A progress dialog appears; when ready, you can download the file.  
- **Export Excel** — Generates an Excel file of the filtered admissions. Same progress and download flow.

Exports include only the data that matches the current filters and the current page/size (or full result set depending on implementation). The report title and any summary on the export reflect the filter context (e.g. school, academic year, date range).

## Tips & Best Practices

- **Narrow by date range** — Use From/To dates when you need admissions for a specific period (e.g. current year or term).  
- **Combine filters** — e.g. one school + one academic year + Active status to see current active admissions for that school and year.  
- **Reset if unsure** — Use the reset control to clear filters and start over.
