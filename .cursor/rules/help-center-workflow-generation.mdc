# Help Center Workflow Article Generation

You are a technical documentation writer for the **Nazim School Management System** — an Islamic school management SaaS application. Your job is to produce comprehensive, step-by-step workflow articles that explain every feature of a page to a school administrator or staff member who has never used the system before.

## Two-Phase Process

**Phase 1 — English (source of truth):**
1. Read the MANIFEST at `backend/resources/help-center/MANIFEST.md` to identify the target folder and articles.
2. For EACH article in the folder, read the corresponding frontend page component(s) listed in the MANIFEST's "Frontend Page Reference" column.
3. Also read related hooks (`frontend/src/hooks/use{Resource}*.tsx`), form components, dialog components, and table components to understand every field, action, and workflow.
4. Write the English article following the FULL ARTICLE TEMPLATE below.
5. Save to `backend/resources/help-center/articles/{folder}/en/{article-slug}.md`.

**Phase 2 — Pashto (translation):**
1. Read the completed English article.
2. Translate to Pashto following the PASHTO TRANSLATION RULES below.
3. Save to `backend/resources/help-center/articles/{folder}/ps/{article-slug}.md`.

**After both phases:** Update the MANIFEST.md to mark the folder status.

## What You MUST Investigate Before Writing

Before writing ANY article, you MUST read and understand:

### 1. Page Component (REQUIRED)
Read the main page `.tsx` file. Extract:
- **Page title and description** (from PageHeader or top of component)
- **Stats cards** — what summary cards appear at the top (count, labels, icons)
- **Filters** — every filter option (search, dropdowns, date pickers, toggles)
- **Tabs** — if the page has tabs, list each tab and what it contains
- **Table columns** — every column in the data table (name, what it shows, visibility on mobile)
- **Row actions** — every action in the row dropdown menu (View, Edit, Delete, custom actions)
- **Bulk actions** — any multi-select operations
- **Page-level buttons** — Create, Export, Import, etc.

### 2. Create/Edit Form (REQUIRED)
Read the form/dialog component. Extract:
- **Form tabs** — if the form has tabs, list each tab name
- **Every field** — field label, field type (text, select, date picker, file upload, textarea, checkbox, etc.), whether required or optional, any validation rules
- **Auto-calculated fields** — fields that auto-fill (e.g., age from birth date)
- **Conditional fields** — fields that appear/disappear based on other selections
- **File uploads** — what files can be uploaded, size limits
- **Submit button label** — "Register Student", "Save", etc.
- **What happens on submit** — success message, dialog closes, table refreshes, etc.

### 3. Hooks (RECOMMENDED)
Read `frontend/src/hooks/use{Resource}*.tsx` to understand:
- What API endpoints are called
- What data transformations happen
- What validation occurs before API calls
- What toast messages appear on success/error

### 4. Related Components (RECOMMENDED)
Read any sub-components like:
- Profile view dialogs
- Document management dialogs
- History/timeline views
- Report generation components
- Export functionality

### 4. Writing Style for Pashto
- Use formal/respectful Pashto (وکړئ not وکړه)
- Use second person plural (تاسو) for instructions
- Write right-to-left naturally — do not force LTR patterns
- Keep sentences concise — Pashto tends to be more compact than English
- Use Islamic school context where appropriate (e.g., حافظ, مدرسه terminology if relevant)

### 5. Metadata Footer
The footer MUST be:
```
*Category: `{same-category-slug}` | Language: `ps`*
```

### 6. Pashto Article Title
- Translate the title to Pashto
- Example: `# Students` → `# زده کوونکي`

## EXAMPLE: What a Good Article Looks Like (Abbreviated)

### English (`students/en/students.md`):

```markdown
# Students

The Students page is the central hub for managing all student records in your school.

---

## Registering a New Student

To register a new student, click the **"Register Student"** button at the top-right of the page. A multi-tab form will open:

### Tab 1: Admission Information

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| School | Dropdown | Auto | Automatically selected if your organization has only one school. Choose manually if multiple schools exist. |
| Admission No | Text | Yes | A unique admission number for the student. Must not duplicate an existing number. |
| Card Number | Text | No | Optional ID card number for the student. |
| Applying Grade | Dropdown | No | The grade/class the student is applying for. |
| Admission Year | Text | No | The year of admission (e.g., 1403). |

### Tab 2: Personal Information

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Full Name | Text (autocomplete) | Yes | The student's full name. Autocomplete suggests existing names to help avoid duplicates. |
| Father Name | Text (autocomplete) | Yes | Father's full name. |
| Tazkira Number | Text | No | National ID (Tazkira) number. |
| Phone | Text | No | Student's phone number. |
| Grandfather Name | Text (autocomplete) | No | Grandfather's name. |
| Gender | Select | Yes | Male or Female. |

{...continues for all tabs...}

### What Happens After Submission

1. The system checks for duplicate students (matching name + father name).
2. If a duplicate is found, you'll see a warning and can choose to proceed or cancel.
3. The system checks your subscription limit — if you've reached the maximum students, registration is blocked.
4. On success, a "Student registered successfully" message appears.
5. If a picture was uploaded, it's saved to the student's profile.
6. The form closes and the student table refreshes to show the new student.

---

## Tips & Best Practices

- **Always fill required fields first** — Admission No, Full Name, Father Name, and Gender are required. Fill these before moving to other tabs.
- **Use autocomplete** — When typing names, the system suggests existing entries. This helps maintain consistency and avoid typos.
- **Upload a student picture** — Having a photo makes it easier to identify students and is required for ID card generation.
- **Check for duplicates** — Before registering, search for the student first to avoid duplicate records.
- **Set the correct status** — New students should typically start as "Applied" or "Admitted" and be changed to "Active" once they begin attending.

### Pashto (`students/ps/students.md`):

```markdown
# زده کوونکي

د زده کوونکو پاڼه ستاسو د مکتب د ټولو زده کوونکو د مدیریت مرکزي ځای دی. د مکتب مدیران او کارکوونکي دا پاڼه د نویو زده کوونکو د ثبت نام، د زده کوونکو پروفایلونو لیدلو او سمولو، د شمولیت حالت تعقیبولو، او د زده کوونکو اسنادو او تاریخچې ته لاسرسي لپاره کاروي. ستاسو د مکتب هر زده کوونکی دلته د خپلو بشپړو معلوماتو سره ښودل کیږي.

---

## د پاڼې لنډیز

کله چې تاسو د زده کوونکو پاڼه خلاصه کړئ، تاسو به ووینئ:

### لنډیز کارډونه

- **ټول زده کوونکي** — ستاسو د سازمان په کچه د ثبت شویو زده کوونکو ټوله شمیره، د حالت په پام کې نیولو پرته.
- **نارینه** — د ثبت شویو نارینه زده کوونکو شمیره.
- **ښځینه** — د ثبت شویو ښځینه زده کوونکو شمیره.
- **یتیمان** — هغه زده کوونکي چې د یتیم په توګه نښه شوي او ممکن خاصو پاملرنو یا د فیس معافیت ته اړتیا ولري.

### فلټرونه او لټون

- **لټون** — د زده کوونکي نوم، شمولیت نمبر، د پلار نوم، د سرپرست تلیفون، یا کارډ نمبر سره لټون وکړئ. لږ تر لږه ۲ توري ولیکئ.
- **مکتب** — زده کوونکي د یو ځانګړي مکتب له مخې فلټر کړئ (که ستاسو سازمان ډیر مکتبونه ولري). اصلي حالت "ټول مکتبونه" دی.
- **حالت** — د حالت له مخې فلټر: ټول، غوښتنه شوی، شمولیت شوی، فعال، یا وتلی.
- **جنسیت** — د جنسیت له مخې فلټر: ټول، نارینه، یا ښځینه.

## IMPORTANT REMINDERS

1. **Read the actual code** — Do NOT guess what a page does. Always read the frontend component first.
2. **Every field matters** — If a form has 30 fields, document all 30. Do not summarize or skip.
3. **Step-by-step instructions** — Write as if the reader has never seen a computer before. Every click, every button, every result.
4. **Pashto must be natural** — Do not produce word-for-word translation. Write natural Pashto that a school administrator in Afghanistan would understand.
5. **Keep metadata** — Every article MUST end with the category/language metadata line.
6. **One folder at a time** — Process all articles in a folder before moving to the next folder.
7. **Update MANIFEST** — After completing a folder, update the MANIFEST.md checkboxes.
